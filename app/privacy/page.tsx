      <h1>Privacy Policy for gettfully</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: January 20, 2024</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the API developed for searching Getty
        ULAN and AAT vocabularies, henceforth referred to as
        &quot;gettfully&quot;. This policy outlines our handling practices for
        the information we collect and you provide while using our API.
      </p>
      <p>1. Data Collection and Use</p>
      <p>
        gettfully does not collect personal information from its users. Our
        service is designed to provide search functionality without the need to
        store personal data. The API hosted on Vercel may use non-identifying
        cookies for analytics purposes. These cookies do not collect personal
        information and are used solely to enhance the performance and
        functionality of our service.
      </p>
      <p>2. No Third-Party Data Sharing</p>
      <p>
        We do not share any user data with third parties. Our commitment is to
        maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your data.
      </p>
      <p>3. User Consent</p>
      <p>
        By using gettfully, you consent to the collection and use of information
        as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Since we do not collect personal
        data, explicit consent for data processing is not required.
      </p>
      <p>4. Data Security</p>
      <p>
        No user data is stored in our system, thus eliminating risks associated
        with data storage and security. We prioritize the protection of any data
        that passes through our API and implement industry-standard measures to
        safeguard our service.
      </p>
      <p>5. User Rights</p>
      <p>
        Since gettfully does not collect or store personal data, issues related
        to access, correction, or deletion of personal data are not applicable.
      </p>
      <p>6. Policy Updates</p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes
        will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy. Users are
        encouraged to periodically review this policy to stay informed about our
        privacy practices.
      </p>
